# House-Price-Prediction
Description
House Price Prediction is a machine learning app designed to estimate house prices based on specific features of a home. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, it predicts the most probable price given certain specifications.

Features
Utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices.
Employs Python programming language.
Uses Jupyter Notebook for code organization and execution.
Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Visualizes data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Technologies Used :-
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Algorithms Used :-
Decision Tree
KNeighborsRegressor
